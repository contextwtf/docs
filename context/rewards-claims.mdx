## How do weekly rewards work?

Every week, Context distributes a pool of USDC among creators, boosters, traders, and referrers. Creators are rewarded for publishing new markets that attract activity, boosters for providing liquidity, traders for buying “Yes” or “No” shares, and referrers for bringing in new users who participate. The more you participate, the larger your share of the reward pool.

## Can reward weights change?
Yes. Some weeks may prioritize rewarding creators more, others traders or boosters.

## How do referrals work?
Each user has a personal referral link. If someone signs up using your link and participates on the platform, you will automatically earn a share of referral rewards.

## How do I claim winnings and rewards?
You must manually claim your rewards. This includes winning trades, returned boosts, and weekly USDC rewards. You can claim them one at a time or click “Claim All” in your profile to collect everything at once.
