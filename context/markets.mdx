## How do I create a market?

To create a new market, click “Create” in the upper right. Type any prompt and collaborate with the AI to phrase your question and resolution rules. Adjust the prompt to edit the resolution sources or dates, and then confirm.


## Do I need to phrase prompts as questions?

No. You can write a prompt as an affirmative, and then the AI will automatically turn it into a clear prediction question.


## Can I edit a market after creating it?

No, markets can’t be edited after creation.


## What happens if duplicate markets are created?
Duplicate markets are allowed. The community will determine which one is most relevant.


## How are market odds determined?

Odds are based on the implied probability of “Yes” from current prices. For example, if “Yes” = \$0.38, the market reflects a 38\% chance.


## How are markets resolved?

Markets are resolved by AI, which reviews the credible news sources that were identified when the market was created (for example, the Associated Press or The New York Times). Once an outcome is determined, the market enters a 24-hour time-lock period before the resolution becomes final.


## Can I dispute a market outcome?

Market outcomes are controlled by our oracle and outcomes are unable to be changed except in extreme cases of downtime or malfunction. If you want to report such a case, please write to  [support@context.markets](mailto:support@context.markets) as soon as possible.
