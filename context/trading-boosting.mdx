title: Trading & Boosting
---

## How do I make a trade?
To make a trade, select a market, choose “Yes” or “No,” enter your trade amount, and confirm the transaction.


## Why does my average price change with bigger trades?
Your average price changes on larger trades because large trades move the market odds. Not all liquidity is available at the current price.


## What is boosting?
Boosting is the process of adding liquidity to a market. More liquid markets tend to attract bigger transactions and overall more transaction volume.


## Who can boost a market?
Anyone can boost, including users based in the United States.


## What happens to my boost after resolution?
Your boosted funds are returned in full, and you may earn additional rewards if the market was active.
