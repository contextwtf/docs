---

RewardDistributor allows Context to distribute any rewards to users via merkle trees. The only non-admin functions are for claiming rewards.

## Claiming Rewards

### Events

```solidity
event RewardClaimed(uint256 indexed epochId, address indexed user, uint256 amount);
```

### Functions

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Claims reward for a specific epoch using a merkle proof
 * @dev Transfers USDC to the caller if the proof is valid and not already claimed
 * @param epochId The epoch ID to claim rewards for
 * @param amount The amount of USDC to claim
 * @param proof Merkle proof verifying the claim
 */
function claimReward(
    uint256 epochId,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32[] calldata proof
);

function batchClaimRewards(
    uint256[] calldata epochIds_,
    uint256[] calldata amounts,
    bytes32[][] calldata proofs
);
```

A leaf of the merkle tree is expected to contain the recipient followed by the amount.

## Admin Actions

The main admin action relevant to a user being able to claim rewards is setting merkle roots, and the relevant event is:

```solidity
event EpochRootSet(uint256 indexed epochId, bytes32 merkleRoot);
```

Once a merkle root is set for an epoch id, users in that merkle tree can claim their rewards. The epoch id and merkle root are needed to claim a reward.
